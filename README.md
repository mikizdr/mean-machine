<h2>WhyMEAN?</h2>
The MEAN stack uses four pieces of software: MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and NodeJS. Using thesefourtoolstogetherletsdeveloperscreateefficient,wellorganized,andinteractiveapplications quickly. Since every component of the stack uses JavaScript, you can glide through your web development code seamlessly. Using all JavaScript lets us do some great things like:
• Use JavaScript on the server-side (Node and Express) • Use JavaScript on the client-side (Angular) • Store JSON objects in MongoDB • Use JSON objects to transfer data easily from database to server to client
A single language across your entire stack increases productivity. Even client side developers that work in Angular can easily understand most of the code on the server side.
Starting with the database, we store information in a JSON like format. We can then write JSON queries on our Node server and send this directly to our front-end using Angular. This is especiallyusefulwhenyouhavemultipledevelopersworkingonaprojecttogether.Server-sidecode becomes more readable to front-end developers and vice versa. This makes everything a little more transparentandhasbeenshowntogreatlyincreasedevelopmenttime.Theeaseofdevelopmentwill become much more apparent once we start digging into examples and hopefully save you and your team some headaches in the future.
